# BBS
BBS

This project uses Spring Boot. The concept is to create a web-based old-school BBS (EX: Telegard, QuickBBS, etc). Currently, this project uses a H2 database. 
I have not determined where this will be hosted, so the final database has not been determined (mySQL, Postgres, etc).

Spring Security with bcrypt has been added to the project and two users have been prepopulated into the database.
